## Important

- For easier task development, I did the task #4 prior to task #2, so queries from task #2 are based on the analytical layers created on task #4 
- All the code used for the 3 firsts tasks are on this repo.
- Presentation can be found [here]().


### Task #1

**Objective**: Evaluate the ability to analyze and interpret key metrics from operational data.
**Scenario**: Analyze the activation process for contracts. Highlight bottlenecks and provide

**Instructions**:
- Calculate % contracts where the Start date was delayed.
- Break down into the top reasons why these contracts were delayed.
- Draw some hypothesis on why contracts might be delayed and suggest actionable
recommendations to improve the onboarding timeline.

#### Solution
- Code is under [/analyses/task_1](/analyses/task_1)
